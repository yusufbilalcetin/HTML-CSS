        <p>This is a <span class="danger-text">another paragraph</span>, and I would like to quate the late,
          great Martin Luther King, Jr. who once said <q>I have a dream</q>.</p>

          <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as
            the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>

          <p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we
            stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great
            beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of
            withering injustice.It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>
